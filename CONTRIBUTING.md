Contributions are welcome, although I don't know what you could realistically want to contribute to this repo :)

Please provide your contributions in the form of PRs. When creating a PR, please avoid putting multiple separate fixes in a single PR;
if possible, prefer separate PRs for each individual fix. This makes it easier to merge non-controversial ones, and discuss other PRs
without creating a cacophony of unrelated comments in the same PR.

Thanks in advance for your contribution!
