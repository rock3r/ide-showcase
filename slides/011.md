## Version control

* The IDE is the best IDE client out there
* Merging conflicts is _magic_ &nbsp;_![img.png](magic-wand.png)_
* Annotate with Git Blame == `git blame` in the editor
  * IJ IDEA 2022.1 introduces authorship annotations to functions
  * Plugins can make it even more useful
* Committing is powerful
  * Commit toolwindow: `Cmd + K`
  * Commit and push: `Cmd + Alt + K`
  * Automatically run tests/reformat/etc. before commit
    * Tip: "tests" can be _any_ Gradle run configuration!
  * Partial commits (hunks)
* GitHub and Space support
  * Review PRs in the IDE!
