### ‚ö†Ô∏è A note about the sample code

The sample code in this repo is there only to display how you can refactor code.
It is terrible, hacky, and should not be used for anything. More than anything, it
should **never** be considered as a template or source of wisdom.

It is bad, and has been purposefully left in a terrible state to demonstrate how much
time you can save by mastering your IDE.

Again, please do **NOT** learn anything from this code. It'll make you dumber. ü´£ I MEAN IT!
